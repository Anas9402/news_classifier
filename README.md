# 📰 News Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies news articles into categories using **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **spaCy**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Text preprocessing with **spaCy** (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).
- Data manipulation and cleaning using **Pandas**.
- Machine learning models implemented with **Scikit-learn** (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Easily extendable to new datasets and categories.
